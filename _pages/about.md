Mostly known as "the guy with the [templates site](//templates.blakadder.com)". Since I like lists and indexing stuff I also built the [Zigbee compatibility](//zigbee.blakadder.com) database.

Inbetween I edit the [Tasmota documentation](//tasmota.com) and maintain [Tasmota Docker](https://github.com/tasmota/docker-tasmota) and [(un)official Tasmota binaries](https://github.com/tasmota/binaries).

You can catch me on [Twitter](//www.twitter.com/blakadder_), [Telegram](https://t.me/blakadder) or on Discord (Blakadder#8319) hanging in [Tasmota community server](https://discord.gg/Ks2Kzd4).
